# fuzzball
Scala fuzzer. [~44 bugs found in Dotty](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/4389) so far and [many more are still unreported](https://github.com/alexknvl/dotty-fuzzing-results). Powered by a two-layer LSTM (400 units) network trained only for a couple hours.

## Installing
```
pip3 install torch numpy
```

## Running
```
python3 -u generate.py --temperature 1.0 --count 30 --predict_len 3000 > out.txt
python3 postprocess.py --samples 3 --maxids 8 out.txt results/
```

### Parameters

High `temperature` (≫ 1.0) - lots of random noise, most samples will be syntactically incorrect. Low `temperature` (≈ 0.0) - little noise, most samples will be syntactically correct.

Keep `predict_len` within 300-3000. If you want only very short snippets, set it low (80-150).

`count` is the number of `predict_len`-long chunks to generate, controls the amount of data that will be generated.

`maxids` controls the maximum number of identifiers in snippets.

Each sample as generated by `generate.py` will further produce `samples` samples after `proprocess.py`ing.

## Examples
Some snippets generated by the fuzzer:
```scala
abstract class i0[+I1] {
def +[I2[I2]: i0[_], i3 <: I2[I2]] = (???) :: i3
val I4 = new i6
val i6: i6 = I5
i6
}

object Boolean {}
trait I0[I0]
object I1 {
def I1[I0](I1: => Int, I2: I1 { type I1 <: I0[I2] } with I0.I0[_]#I0[I1] = new I0[I1])#i3#i3 = new I0[I1] {}
}

abstract class I0() {
val I1 = 1 + 1; case (I1: Nil) => 1;
case Some(I1) =>
I1
}.isInstanceOf[Option][String]{ new I0();
val I1 = ;
def I1: Int = 0 { i3 =>
final def i2: Int => Any = I1
}
}
```
Note that not all snippets will properly parse, and the vast majority of them won't typecheck. It will generate a limited subset of Scala (roughly Scala2 with some Dotty-specific keywords here and there).

## Testing on dotty

Add a new test to `CompilationTests` containing:
```scala
compileFilesInDir("path/to/the/output/files", defaultOptions)
```

and run it using `testOnly` from the `sbt` console.

Optionally, find `compiler/src/dotty/tools/dotc/Run.scala` and add:
```scala
case ex @ (_: StackOverflowError | _: ClassCastException) =>
  ctx.echo(i"exception occurred while compiling $units%, %")
  throw ex
```
to print more stack traces.

## Using squashfs

`postprocess.py` supports writing results into a squashfs archive using `-q` flag:

```
python3 postprocess.py all.txt results/ -q sources.squashfs
```

`results/` is used as a temporary directory if `-q` is supplied.
